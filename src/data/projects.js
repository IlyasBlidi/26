      "Deep learning models for sentiment detection are developed to classify expressions on social media platforms as positive, negative, or neutral. This involves processing and managing large volumes of real-time data from sources like Reddit, leveraging WebSockets for live data transmission. Additionally, the integration of ontologies, semantic graphs, and logical models enhances the organization of textual data and improves the accuracy and interpretability of sentiment analysis.",
